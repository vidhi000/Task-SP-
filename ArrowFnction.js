//Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. It allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions. For example,


const msg = ()=>{
    return "Hello Vidhi Rana"
}
console.log(msg())

let multiply = (a,b)=>a*b


console.log(multiply(3,4))
